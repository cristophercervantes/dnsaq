## Examples

### Subdomain Bruteforcing

```bash
# Basic bruteforcing
dnsaq -d example.com -w wordlist.txt -r resolvers.txt

# With output file and rate limiting
dnsaq -d example.com -w wordlist.txt -r resolvers.txt -o results.txt -rate 5

# With verbose output and disabled wildcard detection
dnsaq -d example.com -w wordlist.txt -r resolvers.txt -v -no-wildcard
```

### Domain Resolution

```bash
# Resolve domains from a file
cat domains.txt | dnsaq -r resolvers.txt

# Resolve domains and save to file
cat domains.txt | dnsaq -r resolvers.txt -o resolved.txt

# With custom resolvers and timeout
cat domains.txt | dnsaq -resolvers "9.9.9.9:53,208.67.222.222:53" -t 5
```

### Integration with Other Tools

```bash
# With subfinder
subfinder -d example.com -silent | dnsaq -r resolvers.txt -o subfinder_results.txt

# With amass
amass enum -passive -d example.com | dnsaq -r resolvers.txt -v

# With assetfinder
assetfinder example.com | dnsaq -r resolvers.txt -o assetfinder_results.txt

# Chaining multiple tools
subfinder -d example.com | dnsaq -r resolvers.txt | httpx -silent
```

---

## Resolver Files

Create a text file with one DNS resolver per line. Comments starting with `#` are supported.

**Example `resolvers.txt`:**

```
# Public DNS resolvers
8.8.8.8
1.1.1.1
9.9.9.9
208.67.222.222

# Additional resolvers
64.6.64.6
77.88.8.8
```

---

## Performance Tuning

### Rate Limiting

Adjust the `-rate` parameter based on your network capacity and target environment:

```bash
# Conservative rate (home networks)
dnsaq -d example.com -w wordlist.txt -rate 5

# Moderate rate (business networks)
dnsaq -d example.com -w wordlist.txt -rate 10-20

# Aggressive rate (dedicated scanning environments)
dnsaq -d example.com -w wordlist.txt -rate 50
```

### Timeout Settings

Adjust timeout based on network reliability:

```bash
# Fast timeout (reliable networks)
dnsaq -d example.com -w wordlist.txt -t 2

# Longer timeout (unreliable networks)
dnsaq -d example.com -w wordlist.txt -t 5
```

---

## Output Format

The tool outputs results in the format:

```
subdomain.example.com [192.168.1.1, 192.168.1.2]
```

When using the `-o` flag, results are simultaneously displayed on stdout and saved to the specified file.
